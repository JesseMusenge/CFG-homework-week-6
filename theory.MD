CFG HW Week 6:

Task 2 (Theory Questions):

Q1:
Git is an example of a distributed version control system.

Q2:
GitHub

Q3:
Modified, staged, committed

Q4:
PR is short for ‘pull request.’ Pull requests are a way to propose changes to repositories. Contributors can submit their modifications, suggest improvements and fix issues through pull requests.

Repo is short for ‘Repository.’ A repository contains a project's source code and allows multiple contributors to work on the code simultaneously. A repository can be hosted locally or on a remote server, such as on GitHub, which allows additional collaboration and management from other users.

Q5:
git pull

Q6:
git fetch

Q7:
git push

Q8:
‘git commit’ requires staged changes and a commit message. To stage a change means using the ‘git add’ command to add files or changes to the staging area. Only the changes that have been staged will be included in the commit. A commit message is a brief description that explains the purpose of the commit.
